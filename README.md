# Star Wars: Unlimited Draft Timer

**A streamlined tool designed for judges to manage Draft events in the Limited format.**

Keeping a draft on track can be chaotic. This timer automates the logistics, allowing judges to focus on floor coverage and player needs rather than the clock.

### Key Features
* **Automated Prompts:** Displays suggested verbal commands for the caller to ensure clear and consistent communication.
* **Direction & Count Tracking:** Live tracking of drafting direction (Left/Right) and the current card count for each pack.
* **Event Logging:** A complete history log records every command issued for audit and event review.

### Rule Compliance
All timings and intervals within this tool are sourced from the official **Star Wars: Unlimited Comprehensive Event Guide** (Current as of February 3, 2026).

### How to Use

1.  **Initialize the Draft:** Open the web app on your device (mobile or desktop).
2.  **Start Pack 1:** Click the **"Start Pack"** button. The timer will display the current pack number and the drafting direction.
3.  **Follow the Prompts:** Read the **Suggested Commands** aloud to the players. These update automatically based on the current pick and timing.
4.  **Manage the Flow:** Initiate the countdown using the **blue start button**.. 
    * If necessary, you can **skip or rewind** steps to correct the draft state. 
    * A **Reset** option is available to start over from the beginning; this includes a safety confirmation to prevent accidental resets.
5.  **Review the Log:** If a player has a question or if there is a discrepancy, check the **History Log** at the bottom of the screen for a timestamped record of all commands.

### Pro-Tips for Judges
* **Stay Awake:** To prevent your device from locking during the draft, ensure your screen's "Auto-Lock" or "Sleep" timer is set to a higher interval or disabled.
* **Dispute Resolution:** If a player claims the count is off, refer immediately to the **History Log**. It serves as the "source of truth" for how many cards should be in the current hand.
